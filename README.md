# Exercise: Styling a Personal Profile Page

## Objective
Create a personal profile page that includes a photo, a brief bio, and a list of hobbies or interests. The page should be visually appealing and demonstrate the use of various CSS properties and selectors.

## Requirements

### 1. HTML Structure
Start with an HTML file that includes:
- A header section with your name.
- A section for a profile picture.
- A section for a brief bio.
- A list of hobbies or interests.

### 2. CSS Styling
- Use **class and ID selectors** to apply styles.
- Style the header to be visually distinct from the rest of the page (consider background color, text color, and font size).
- Style the profile picture to have a circular shape and add a border. Ensure the image is appropriately sized.
- Use **font styles** and **colors** to make the bio section engaging.
- Style the list of hobbies/interests with custom bullet points or icons.

### 3. Layout
- Use **Flexbox** or **Grid** to layout the page content. The profile picture should be to the left of the bio, and the list of hobbies/interests should be below both.
- Ensure the layout is responsive and looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.

### 4. Advanced (Optional)
- Add a hover effect to the list items in the hobbies/interests section.
- Incorporate a **Google Font** for the text on the page.
- Add a simple animation when the page loads (e.g., fade-in effect for the profile picture or bio section).

## Deliverables
Submissions can be made using online IDEs such as [Replit](https://replit.com/) or [CodePen](https://codepen.io/). These platforms allow for easy sharing and review of the projects.
