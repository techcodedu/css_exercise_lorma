## Build It Live! Your First Website with HTML & CSS

**Project Goal:** Create a cool website you design and bring it to life on the internet!

**Project Steps (4 Weeks):**

**Week 1: Plan Your Website**

1. **Team Up:** Find 4 partners for brainstorming and building.
2. **Pick an Idea:** Brainstorm what kind of website you want to make (e.g., about your hobbies, a game, showcasing your art).
3. **Draw Your Website (Mockup):** Using paper, a drawing app, or an online tool, sketch how your website will look. Think about sections, images, and how users will navigate.
4. **Responsive Design:** Discuss how your website should adjust for different screen sizes (phones, tablets, computers).

**Weeks 2 & 3: Build Your Website**

1. **Code Your Website:** You'll be using two coding languages: HTML and CSS.
    - **HTML:** This is like the skeleton of your website, defining the content and its organization.
    - **CSS:** This is like the paint and style, making your website look cool and work on different screens.
2. **Start with Content Placeholders:** Use fake text and images while you focus on the website's structure and styling.
3. **Add Real Content:** Gradually fill your website with your chosen theme (e.g., descriptions about your hobbies, rules for your game, pictures of your art).
4. **Test It Out:** Check your website on different devices to make sure everything looks good and works as intended. Fix any problems you find.

**Week 4: Get Your Website Online!**

1. **Git Version Control (Optional):** Learn a cool tool developers use to keep track of their code changes (not essential for this project, but good to know!).
2. **Deploy to GitHub Pages:** Make your website live on the internet for free using GitHub Pages! This will give it a special web address everyone can access.
3. **Presentation Time:** Show everyone your website! Explain your design choices and what you learned while building it.
